<h3>ABNER BOLTON.</h3>

<p>"Now I'll see about makin' the saddle," said Bob, "'cause I've seen 'em
a good many times in a circus, an' I know jest how they're made. While
I'm doin' that, you fellers must be fixin' 'bout who else we'll have in
the show. Leander Leighton will come up here to-morrow, so's we can hear
how he plays, an' we must have everything fixed by then."</p>

<p>"Why didn't he come to-day?" asked Ben, thinking that all the members of
the firm should have been present at this first rehearsal.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/ill_003.jpg" width="400" height="252" alt="" />
<span class="caption">LEANDER IS ENGAGED AT HOME.</span>
</div>

<p>"Well, you see, he had to split some wood, an' he had to take care of
the baby. I offered to help him with the wood; but he said he couldn't
get away any quicker if I did, for just as soon as the baby saw another
feller waitin' 'round, she'd yell so awful hard he'd have to stay in all
day."</p>

<p>This explanation as to the absence of the band appeared to be perfectly
satisfactory to those present, and they began to discuss the merits of
certain of their companions in order to decide upon the proper ones to
enlist as members, since the number of their performers was not so large
as they thought it should be in a show where an admission fee of three
cents was to be charged.</p>

<p>Just as they were getting well into their discussion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span> and, of course,
speaking of such matters as managers should keep a profound secret from
the public, Bob cried out:</p>

<p>"There comes Abner Bolton! He's always runnin' 'round where he ain't
wanted; an' I wonder how he come to know we was here? I'll send him off
mighty quick, now you see."</p>

<p>The boy who had disturbed Bob so greatly was so near when he was first
discovered that by the time the threat had been uttered he was close
upon them. He was a small boy, not more than eight years old, and hardly
as large as a boy of six should be; he walked on crutches because of his
deformed legs, which hung withered and almost useless, barely capable of
supporting his slight weight.</p>

<p>"Now, what do <i>you</i> want?" asked Bob, in an angry tone.</p>

<p>"I don't want anything," was the mild reply, as the cripple halted just
outside the shade, as if not daring to come any farther until invited.
"I heard you was goin' to get up a circus, an' I thought perhaps you'd
let me watch you, 'cause I wouldn't bother you any."</p>

<p>"You would bother us, an' you can't stay 'round here, for we ain't goin'
to have anybody watchin' us. You may come to the show if you can get
three cents."</p>

<p>"I don't s'pose I could do that," said the boy, looking longingly toward
the shade, but still standing in the sun. "I don't have any chance to
get money, an' I do wish you boys would let me stay where you are, for
it's so awful lonesome out to the poor-farm, an' I can't run around as
you can."</p>

<p>"Well, you can't stay here, an' the sooner you go back to the farm the
better we'll like it, for we don't want anybody to know what we're
talkin' about."</p>

<p>Toby had attempted to speak once or twice while Bob was engaged with the
cripple from the poor-farm; but he did not get an opportunity until
Abner turned to go away, looking thoroughly sad and disheartened.</p>

<p>"Don't go, Abner, but come and set down here where it's cool, an'
perhaps we can fix it for you."</p>

<p>The cripple turned as Toby spoke, and the look which came into his face
went right to the heart of the boy, who for ten long weeks had known
what it was to be almost without a friend.</p>

<p>"I don't see what you want him 'round here for," said Bob, petulantly,
as Abner seated himself by Toby's side, thoroughly exhausted by his long
walk. "He can't do nothin'; an' if he could, we don't want no fellers
from the poor-farm mixed up with the show."</p>

<p>"It don't make any difference if he does live to the poor-farm," said
Toby, as he put his little brown hand on Abner's thin fingers. "He can
belong to the show jest as well as not; an' if you fellers will let him,
I'll give you my part of all the money we make."</p>

<p>This proposition of Toby's put the matter on a very different basis, and
both Ben and Bob now looked favorably inclined toward it.</p>

<p>"Don't you do that, Toby," said Abner, his eyes filling with tears
because of the kindness shown him. "I'll go right away, an' I won't come
into the village again to bother you."</p>

<p>"You shall come into the village every day, Abner, an' you won't bother
us at all, for you shall go 'long of me everywhere I do, an' I won't
never walk any faster'n you can;" and Toby moved his seat nearer Abner,
to show that he took him under his especial care.</p>

<p>"He might help tend the door," said Joe, kindly, anxious to please Toby,
"an' that'll give me a chance to do more howlin' for the hyenas, 'cause
that'll be about all I oughter do if I have to hold the hoops."</p>

<p>"Yes, he can do that;" and Toby was very eager now. "An' we can get him
a stool to sit on, an' he can do jest as much as if he could stand up."</p>

<p>By this time Bob and Ben had decided that, in consideration of Toby's
offer, Abner should be counted as one of the company, and the matters
under discussion that had been interrupted by the cripple's coming were
again taken up.</p>

<p>Owing to the possible chance that Joe could not succeed in training the
blind horse sufficiently to make him useful in the ring, it was
necessary to know just what animals they could procure, and Bob offered
to see Chandler Merrill for the purpose of securing the services of his
Mexican pony, which had never allowed any one to ride him without first
having a severe battle.</p>

<p>"We can train him down all right," said Bob; "an' you fellers come down
now while I find out 'bout the pony, so's we can come back here after
dinner."</p>

<p>As it was very important that this matter should be settled as soon as
possible, Bob's advice was acted upon; and as the boys started to go,
Toby said:</p>

<p>"Come, Abner, you come home with me an' get some dinner, an' then you
can come back here when I do."</p>

<p>Bob was disposed to make sport of this sudden friendship; but Toby paid
no attention to what he said, and if any of them wanted to talk to him,
they too were obliged to walk with the boy from the poor-farm.</p>

<p>By the time they arrived at Uncle Daniel's, Toby had formed many plans
for making the life of the homeless boy more cheerful than it ever had
been.</p>

<p>Toby's interest in the crippled boy whom he had taken under his charge
was considerably greater than in the contemplated circus; and both Bob
and Ben felt angry and injured when, in the midst of some brilliant plan
for startling those of the good people of Guilford who should come to
their circus, Toby would stop to say something to Abner, who was
hobbling along as fast as possible in order that he might not oblige the
party to wait for him.</p>

<p>For a number of years Toby had known that there was a crippled orphan at
the poor-farm; but it so happened that he had not met him very often,
and even then he had no idea of the lonely life the boy was obliged to
lead.</p>

<p>On the way to the village he had formed several plans by which he might
aid Abner; but none of them could be put into operation until after he
had consulted Uncle Daniel and Aunt Olive.</p>

<p>It was nearly noon, and the understanding was that each one should get
his dinner and go to the pasture again, when it would be known whether
they were to be able to number Chandler Merrill's pony among the
attractions of their show, or be wholly dependent upon the disabled
horses that as yet made up their collection.</p>

<p>"You're comin' to get dinner with me, Abner," said Toby, as he stopped
in front of Uncle Daniel's gate, while the little fellow was continuing
on his way to the only place he could call home, there to get his dinner
with the other paupers.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid your aunt won't want me," he said, shyly, while it was plain
to be seen that he would be more than well pleased to accept the
invitation.</p>

<p>"Aunt Olive won't care a bit, an' she'll be glad to have you, I know,
'cause she says it always does her good to see hungry people eat, though
if that's so, I must have done her an awful sight of good lots of times,
for it don't seem to me I ever set down to the table in my life but what
I was awful hungry. Come on now, so's we'll have time to get our hands
an' faces washed before the dinner-bell rings."</p>

<p>Abner followed Toby in a hesitating way, much as if he expected each
moment to be ordered back; and when they arrived at the door he stood on
the threshold, not daring to enter until permission had been given.</p>

<p>"This is Abner Bolton, Uncle Dan'l," said Toby, as he saw that his newly
made friend would not come in without an invitation from some one
besides himself. "He lives out to the poor-farm, an' he don't have any
such nice home as I've got, so I thought you wouldn't care if I brought
him in to dinner."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p>

<p>"You've got a good heart, Toby, boy, and the Lord will reward you for
it," said Uncle Daniel, as he stroked the boy's refractory hair. And
then he said to Abner, "Come in, my lad, and share Toby's dinner; nor
need you ever hesitate about accepting any such invitation when it leads
you here."</p>

<p>Then Aunt Olive greeted Abner so kindly that the poor boy hardly knew
whether it was reality or a dream, so strange was it all to him.</p>

<p>During the dinner Toby told of the difficulty he had had in getting his
partners to consent to Abner's being one of the company, and Aunt Olive,
who had shown considerable interest in the circus scheme, said:</p>

<p>"Why don't you let him keep a stand, and then he can make some money for
himself. I will bake him a lot of doughnuts and ginger-snaps, and your
uncle Dan'l will lend him money enough to buy lemons an' sugar. It will
be a deal better than to have Nahum Baker there with his pies that are
as heavy as lead, an' doughnuts that have soaked up all the fat in the
pan."</p>

<p>Toby was delighted with the plan, and Abner's eyes glistened at the mere
idea that it might be possible for him to do, once in his life at least,
as did other and more fortunate boys.</p>

<h2><a name="TOM_FAIRWEATHERS_VISIT_TO_THE_SULTAN_OF_BORNEO" id="TOM_FAIRWEATHERS_VISIT_TO_THE_SULTAN_OF_BORNEO">TOM FAIRWEATHER'S VISIT TO THE SULTAN OF BORNEO.</a></h2>

<h3>BY LIEUTENANT E.&nbsp;W. STURDY, U.S.N.</h3>

<p>Our sailor-boy, Tom Fairweather, leaned over the ship's side, watching
the return of the steam-launch.</p>

<p>A message had been sent to no less a personage than the Sultan of
Borneo, or perhaps I should have said an embassy. So grand a personage
as a Sultan calls for such a ceremonious term. Don't you think so, young
people?</p>

<p>The ship lay in the Chinese Sea off the coast of the island of Borneo,
and some fifteen miles from the town of Bruni, or Borneo, as it is
sometimes called.</p>

<p>As Tom stood there, a succession of wise thoughts coursed through his
head; wise, that is, for a young gentleman of his age&mdash;twelve,
by-the-way. These thoughts included the position of the equator. Tom
felt himself to be quite old friends with the equator by this time, so
often had he "crossed the line."</p>

<p>When he had first studied geography he had regarded such a performance
as quite remarkable, and on a par with sailing or sledging to either
pole. The thoughts of geography brought to his mind the book he had used
at school, <i>Maury's Manual</i>, which contained a number of illustrations.
Tom distinctly recalled a picture in this book, beneath which was
written "The Sultan of Borneo." The Sultan was resplendent in a flowing
flowered robe, which Tom supposed to be of brocade. He wore Turkish
trousers, a turban on his head, and mutton-chop whiskers. The only touch
of carelessness about his costume was his bare feet. He reposed in a
grove of palms, and in one hand held a long hookah. Take him all in all,
he bore a strong resemblance to the Sultans in the <i>Arabian Nights
Entertainment</i>, one of Tom's favorite volumes, and who, as other boys
and girls are well aware, were all very wealthy and lordly people
indeed.</p>

<p>As Tom had never seen a live Sultan before, he was most anxious to visit
his Sultanship of Borneo. He therefore broke out in a whistle of pleased
expectation, for it was distinctly understood that he was to be of the
party making the formal visit.</p>

<p>The Sultan, it appeared, had graciously signified his entire willingness
to be called upon; so Tom made a few additions to his toilet, which he
considered were called for by the magnificence of the occasion; that is
to say, he put on his watch and chain, as well as a ring with a large
red stone, which the man in Ceylon of whom he had bought it had told him
was a ruby. He felt extremely important and a little overawed when he
was seated in the launch on his way to the Sultan's abode.</p>

<p>To begin with, he was somewhat surprised at the appearance of Bruni as
they neared it. "Huts!" he said, in astonishment. "With thatched roofs.
Are all the houses like these? Why, this doesn't look like a city at
all. Maury's Geography said this was the capital. This is a high old
capital, I must say."</p>

<p>"There are capitals and capitals," returned his father. "Did you expect
something like Washington? I must admit that the splendor of Borneo is
rather down at heels&mdash;but so it goes."</p>

<p>The residence of the Sultan was a thatched hut, very much like those of
which the rest of the town was composed. It was built on piles driven
into the river-bed, and was entered by steps leading down to the water.
There were other houses thus set up on piles, and behind those still
others, until finally the rest of the town straggled against and on top
of the river-bank.</p>

<p>Tom followed his father up the steps with feelings in which
disappointment struggled with curiosity. His expectations had already
received a series of shocks, but this was too much. A King's palace to
have dwindled down to this shabby little hut!</p>

<p>They entered into the royal presence. Captain Fairweather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span> and his
officers were received by two interpreters, who made them welcome in
very broken English, and then led the way to the head of the room, where
stood the Sultan. He was almost a hundred years old. Don't suppose from
this that such is the average age of Sultans. But this particular one,
Abdul Momin, had actually attained that ripe old age, from which we may
gather that his dignities agreed with him. There is something impressive
in old age, whether it be that of prince or peasant; but beyond this the
old man before whom Tom found himself bowing politely was certainly not
in the least remarkable. He was a very shabby old man indeed. He wore a
single soiled garment&mdash;a gown which reached to his feet. As though to
make him as unlike the Sultan in <i>Maury's Manual</i> as possible, he wore
slippers (such as they were); and finally there was a common little cap
on his head instead of the silken turban, bound with pearls, of Tom's
imagination.</p>

<p>The Sultan could not speak English, and the officers could not
understand him, so that the conversation would have flagged had it not
been for the interpreters referred to above. One of these was the Funny
Man one meets all over the world, who sees a joke in everything, and
laughs at it himself, whether you are amused or not. But this man was
really very funny. He rubbed his hands and bowed and laughed over
everything that was said, until it was impossible not to be in good
spirits. He evidently considered it quite a good joke that so many fine
gentlemen in uniform, with gold epaulets and clanking swords, should
have taken the trouble to look up such a seedy old Sultan as Abdul
Momin. Having made the presentations in due form, he proceeded to do the
honors of the one-roomed palace. There was very, very little furniture
to look at; but the officers showed a determination to be pleased, and
admired all that this interpreter, in his flourishing way, pointed out
to their notice.</p>

<p>"That's a nice rug," said Lieutenant Jollytarre.</p>

<p>"Yes; Sultan borrow that when he know you coming," replied the
interpreter.</p>

<p>"Those are nice pipes," proceeded Tom, following in the wake, as he was
in the habit of doing, of his friend Lieutenant Jollytarre.</p>

<p>"Borrowed too," rejoined the interpreter, with a wink.</p>

<p>Coffee was handed around, served in pretty little cups of Japanese ware.
Captain Fairweather, by way of making conversation, in his turn, admired
these cups. "Ah! Kioto ware?" said he.</p>

<p>"Kioto; yes, yes," replied the interpreter, to whom the remark was
addressed. "Chinaman keep shop in Bruni. Sultan borrow cups of him."
Thereupon he winked more decidedly than before.</p>

<p>"Well!" exclaimed Tom; "don't the Sultan own anything? I suppose the
slippers on his feet are his at least."</p>

<p>"Borrowed," ejaculated the interpreter, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>Tom was now convulsed with laughter; seeing which, the interpreter
winked again&mdash;this time gravely.</p>

<p>Captain Fairweather finally took out his watch, and remarked, "We must
be off if we wish to see anything more of Bruni."</p>

<p>With ceremonious politeness the officers took leave of the Sultan, all
of which impressed Tom as highly absurd. On shore there were, as stated,
more thatched huts&mdash;these too were set on piles in order to prevent the
venomous reptiles native to these shores from crawling in and out the
open doors.</p>

<p>"Lots of tribes in Borneo," piped up the interpreter. "This tribe
Muruts&mdash;head-hunters."</p>

<span class="caption">THE HEAD-HUNTERS OF BORNEO.</span>
</div>

<p>Tom stood transfixed in mute, horrified astonishment in front of the
nearest hut. Its steep projecting roof had fallen somewhat into decay;
the thatching in some places had fallen quite off. Before the doorway a
group of natives were gathered, attracted by the strangers. They stared
at the strangers, who in turn stared back with equal curiosity.
Suspended across the doorway was a string of human heads&mdash;yes, horrible
to relate&mdash;of human heads in different states of decomposition. "He
great head-hunter," said the interpreter, pointing to the owner of the
hut. "Count heads&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Twenty," announced Tom, solemnly, completing the count.</p>

<p>"These fellows bring home a head as a token of their prowess, just as a
North American Indian brings home a scalp," explained Mr. Jollytarre.
"They make a raid into another tribe, kill a man, and back they come
with it as an evidence of their courage and skill. The more heads a man
takes, the greater distinction he attains in his tribe. Nothing is
thought of him by his own people until he chops off a head."</p>

<p>Tom looked again at the string of heads, and exclaimed, "Faugh! it makes
me ill. I almost wish I hadn't come."</p>

<p>But disagreeable things are short-lived in a boy's mind. The
head-hunters and their ghastly trophies faded away as he asked questions
upon questions about Borneo, on his way back to the ship.</p>

<p>"The third largest island in the world," he repeated to himself.
"Australia, New Guinea, Borneo&mdash;and if you don't count Australia an
island, it's the second. Well, well, it's a queer place anyway, and I
don't think much of it, whatever its size may be."</p>

<h2><a name="AT_THE_DOGS_HOSPITAL" id="AT_THE_DOGS_HOSPITAL">AT THE DOGS' HOSPITAL.</a></h2>

<h3>BY MISS F.&nbsp;E. FRYATT.</h3>

<p>All the family were present and took part in the council; even
grandmamma, who was dozing in the corner, expressed an opinion in her
sleep.</p>

<p>The subject was a grave one, suggesting alarming possibilities, for if a
hot, dry nose, dull eyes, a general droop of the body, and aversion to
food meant anything, Pepper's was a serious illness&mdash;and what was to
come of it?</p>

<p>"I, for one," said Aunt Maria, "am fearful that it is hydropho&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please don't say that," pleaded Dick, piteously. "Papa would have him
shot."</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" cried Harry, his eyes filling at the mere thought.</p>

<p>"Maria, can not you think of something or other?" exclaimed Aunt Phebe,
helplessly.</p>

<p>"Put his feet in hot water with plenty of mustard in it, and a dose of
rhubarb and magnesia," advised grandmamma, in her sleep.</p>

<p>"It isn't the baby, mother; it's Pepper that's sick," replied Aunt
Maria.</p>

<p>At this moment Uncle Fritz's welcome voice was heard at the hall door.
The boys darted up stairs to tell their griefs, and ask a hundred
questions.</p>

<p>"Oh, brother, that dreadful dog has gone and made himself ill!" was Miss
Maria's greeting.</p>

<p>"What <i>shall</i> we do for him?" was Miss Phebe's.</p>

<p>"Mustard draughts and hive syrup best thing in the world," murmured the
old lady, uneasily.</p>

<p>"Don't fret, mother; no one's ill but Pepper," said Mr. Hayes, following
his sisters to where the invalid was lying.</p>

<p>Four faces brightened visibly as Uncle Fritz pronounced it a case of
distemper, and not hydrophobia, and recommended removal to the hospital.</p>

<p>"The hospital!" exclaimed both boys in wonder.</p>

<p>"Yes, children; and the sooner, the more hope for his recovery.
By-the-way, Maria, if you have a covered basket, a piece of carpet, and
Pepper's basin ready, we'll get him off at once."</p>

<p>The boys were wild with excitement. Pepper would not be shot after all;
he was going to be cured.</p>

<p>After stroking his glossy sides, to which he responded by a feeble wag
of his tail, they took off his silver collar and bells, lifted him
tenderly into the basket, called the family to bid him good-by, and
departed with their uncle.</p>

<p>"It's a mercy he has gone. Suppose he had bitten Smoke?" remarked Miss
Maria, closing the hall door.</p>

<p>"I shall miss him, for all that," sighed Miss Phebe.</p>

<p>Soon Pepper, curled up in the basket on Uncle Fritz's knee in the
elevated car, was rushing toward his destination. Where that was he
little cared, he was so truly miserable.</p>

<p>A black-and-tan of "high degree," his dainty paws had never trodden
rougher ways than the velvet carpets of his mistress's mansion, or the
smooth lawns of his master's garden. He slept on silken cushions, took
his airings in Miss Maria's carriage, and had his food served in
porcelain. Not even Smoke, the petted Maltese, dared to put her nose
within a foot of his basin. Alas! how much of this was to be changed!</p>

<p>A few minutes' ride and a short walk brought the boys and Mr. Hayes to
the gate of a low, curious, but gayly painted cottage; on either side of
the entrance were piled cages of birds and animals.</p>

<p>On the top of the porch Dick saw, with an uncomfortable sinking at his
heart, a stuffed dog that looked much the worse for continual exposure
to the weather. Below hung a framed picture of odd-looking dogs,
labelled "Famous," while a sign hanging near announced that Dr. Blank,
Importer, Doctor, and Taxidermist, was prepared to sell, board, cure,
and stuff all kinds of birds and domestic animals.</p>

<p>Dick was greatly re-assured when, peeping through the palings, he saw
several little dogs comfortably basking in the sunshine before the door,
but was fairly delighted at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span> the frolicking company that greeted them on
entering the cottage. As he afterward said, he could not tell which
jumped the highest, wagged their tails the hardest, barked the loudest,
or cut the funniest capers, the Yorkshire terriers, the Skyes, or the
English pugs.</p>

<p>In the midst of the uproar a back door opened, and in came the Doctor, a
sharp-faced little man, with a troop of dogs at his heels.</p>

<p>"Down with you, Tiger. Be quiet, Meg. Off with you, Bess. Don't be
frightened, young gentlemen, they're all educated dogs."</p>

<p>As soon as he could make himself heard, Mr. Hayes explained the purpose
of their visit.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/ill_005.jpg" width="600" height="361" alt="" />
<span class="caption">DR. BLANK GIVING PEPPER HIS MEDICINE.</span>
</div>

<p>Pepper was drawn forth from the basket, held up by the nape of his neck,
and examined. The Doctor felt his body, rubbed his nose, and lifted his
eyelids; then said solemnly: "A very sick dog; heart's affected; pulse
irregular; lungs bad. But while there's life, there's hope, sir. I'll
engage to cure him if any one can."</p>

<p>At this unexpected close to this ominous speech, the boys grew cheerful
again, and ventured to ask where Pepper would sleep.</p>

<p>A large clean cage was selected, and Dick allowed to spread the carpet,
put the basin in, and lay Pepper upon his bed. Thus he was installed as
a regular boarder patient in the Dogs' Hospital.</p>

<p>"Misery loves company," it is said. If that is true, Pepper must have
been pleased, for there were half a dozen sick dogs in the cages near
him.</p>

<p>Their pet once comfortably settled, Dick and Harry, like true boys,
expressed their curiosity to see and hear the histories of the other
boarders. Dr. Blank condescended to gratify them.</p>

<p>"This one," said the Doctor, indicating a glossy red bantam, "is Dandy,
a performing rooster.</p>

<p>"These Angora rabbits in the next cage are Bunny and Belle, the
pantomimists; play in <i>Humpty Dumpty</i>; owned by a lady in Europe, sir.</p>

<p>"In this cage, sir, is Binney, owned by a banker; he's a fine Maltese,
three months old, and weighs seventeen pounds.</p>

<p>"This next one, this fine tabby, is Jim, an editor's cat, worth a
thousand dollars!"</p>

<p>"Whew!" exclaimed Dick, "I didn't know any cat was worth that."</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen, look at these beauties. Kate and Mollie,
carrier-pigeons, owned by a sailor. These in the lower row are tumblers,
puffers, and fantails&mdash;for sale, gentlemen."</p>

<p>Dick commenced counting his savings mentally; wondered which would be
the nicer to buy, pigeons or rabbits. Being introduced to a family of
guinea-pigs a moment later, was puzzled, and finally decided to buy one
of each.</p>

<p>"Now for the dogs, sir," continued the Doctor, with the air of a
showman. "Here, Flirt, stand up and show how you can dance."</p>

<p>In a twinkling a pretty silver terrier, with its hair "banged"
beautifully above the eyes, stood up on its hind-legs, held its head
sideways, and holding its fore-paws like a young kangaroo, danced around
the room to the boys' wondering delight.</p>

<p>"That'll do, Flirt," commanded the Doctor. "Now, Baron, show how you can
jump."</p>

<p>Baron was the queerest-looking small creature, an English pug with a
fawn-colored body, and a knotted-up, wrinkled, sooty little visage
expressive of the greatest contempt and ill-nature&mdash;a visage that
greatly belied him, for he was the gentlest of all dogs.</p>

<p>At the word "over," he leaped to the top of the half-door, and thence
into the yard.</p>

<p>"Well done, you little hero!" cried Dick.</p>

<p>Queenie and Rosie, a pair of tiny Yorkshires, and Snap, a black-and-tan,
who "could kill forty rats in a minute," were next introduced. Dick
thought the latter almost equal to Pepper, who, by-the-way, never killed
any.</p>

<p>"Now, come out-doors, gentlemen, and look at our other boarders before
supper-time," said the Doctor.</p>

<p>In an instant Mr. Hayes and the boys were surrounded by dogs great and
small. A fine blood-hound thrust its cold nose against Harry's cheek, a
red Irish setter licked his hand, and a pair of white bull-dogs, by
clumsy antics and friendly nudgings, tried to make his acquaintance,
while a number of bull-terriers, Newfoundland, and pointer pups engaged
in a rough-and-tumble play that was very amusing.</p>

<p>In a shed at one corner of the yard the boys spied a young man preparing
the dogs' supper. Dick whispered, "There'll be fun by-and-by."</p>

<p>The boys had just time, after they examined two or three families of
terrier puppies, to peep between the bars at two very distinguished
boarders who had recently arrived from Europe&mdash;an English mastiff and a
Scotch collie or shepherd dog&mdash;who had separate apartments and dined
alone, when supper was announced by a long, shrill whistle.</p>

<p>"Now they'll fight," said Dick, in a tone of expectation; but he was
mistaken.</p>

<p>The dogs marched to supper like a company of soldiers. Two lads presided
over the tubs and troughs from which the larger ones ate, while a young
woman fed the smaller ones daintier fare from earthen dishes.</p>

<p>Although there were neither napkins nor finger-bowls, and not one of the
dogs had ever heard of, much less read, <i>Lord Chesterfield on
Politeness</i>, they all behaved with as much decorum as so many boys and
girls at a tea party.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"At any rate," said Miss Maria that evening, "Pepper will not lose his
manners there, and if he dies we can let the Doctor stuff him."</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="THE_QUEENS_REPARATION" id="THE_QUEENS_REPARATION">THE QUEEN'S REPARATION.</a></h2>

<p>In 1822, the Society Islands, which had previously been governed by
chiefs according to their own pleasure, came under the influence of the
Christian religion. One of the first things the islanders did was to
assemble and agree upon a code of laws, which were to be equally binding
upon the King and his lowest subject.</p>

<p>A few months after the adoption of this code the Queen of Tahiti visited
Huahine. Her attendants requiring a piece of timber, she directed them
to cut down a bread-fruit-tree which grew in a garden near the place
where she was resting with her people.</p>

<p>In the evening, when the owner came home from his work in the fields, he
saw what had been done. There lay the branches strewn around. There was
the bleeding stump. But the tree, his pride and delight, was gone.</p>

<p>Informed by his neighbors that the Queen's men had cut it down, he went
at once to the magistrate and lodged a complaint against her Majesty.
The magistrate directed him to appear at sunrise the next morning, and
bring witnesses to prove his charge. The Queen also received a summons
to attend.</p>

<p>At the appointed hour, Ori, the Judge, was seated on the ground beneath
a mighty tree. On a finely woven mat before him reclined the Queen,
surrounded by attendants. Beside her stood the peasant, her accuser, and
back of them, all a number of men who seemed to be police officers.</p>

<p>Turning to the plaintiff, whose name was Teuhe, Ori asked for what
purpose they were assembled. The poor man replied:</p>

<p>"O magistrate, in my garden there grew a bread-fruit-tree. Its shelter
was thrown over my cottage. Its fruit supported my children. Yesterday
some one came and cut it down. They tell me the Queen sent him to do
so.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span> What I desire to ask is, whether the law was made only for kings,
or for poor men too?"</p>

<p>The magistrate, turning to the Queen, asked if she had ordered this. She
answered, "Yes." He then asked if she did not know that they had laws.
She said, "Yes"; but she was not aware that they applied to her. The
magistrate asked if in those laws&mdash;a copy of which he held in his
hand&mdash;there were any exceptions in favor of chiefs, or kings, or queens.
She answered, "No," and dispatched one of her attendants to her house,
who soon returned with a bag of money, which she threw down before the
poor man, as a recompense for his loss.</p>

<p>"Stop," said the Justice; "we have not done yet." The Queen began to
weep. "Do you think it right that you should have cut down the tree
without asking the owner's permission?" continued the magistrate. "It
was not right," said the Queen. Then turning to the poor man, he asked,
"What remuneration do you require?" Teuhe answered, "If the Queen is
convinced that it was not right to take a little man's tree without his
permission, I am sure she will not do so again. I am satisfied; I
require no other recompense." His disinterestedness was applauded, the
assembly dispersed, and afterward, I think, the Queen sent him privately
a present equal to the value of his tree.</p>

<h2><a name="CAPTAIN_EDWARDSS_BIG_WHALE" id="CAPTAIN_EDWARDSS_BIG_WHALE">CAPTAIN EDWARDS'S BIG WHALE.</a></h2>

<h3>BY EESUNG EYLISS.</h3>

<p>"Uncle Horace, I have just been down to the foot of Wall Street to see
the whale."</p>

<p>"I am very glad you have done so, Bennie. What did you think of it, and
what did it look like?"</p>

<p>"When I went in, the great creature was lying on a board floor under a
large canvas tent, and about twenty persons were examining it. Oh, it
was so fat! Great gashes had been made in its sides, and through them
you could see what they called the 'blubber.' I saw Captain Edwards
there too. He was talking to another gentleman, and telling him all
about how he caught the whale."</p>

<p>"Well, and how was it?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 215px;">
<img src="images/ill_006.jpg" width="215" height="400" alt="" />
<span class="caption">CAPTAIN EDWARDS.</span>
</div>

<p>"Why, you see, the Captain was aboard his ship, the <i>Fanny Sprague</i>, and
they were sailing along the coast of Long Island, between Amagansett and
East Hampton. This whale had been seen about there several times, and
they were just after it. Well, one morning&mdash;I remember the very date; it
was March 15&mdash;they caught sight of it. The boats were lowered, and away
the whalemen went in pursuit. As they came alongside, Mr. Fee, the mate,
who was in the bow of one of the boats, ready with harpoon in hand,
hurled it in deep just below where the shoulder-blade would be. This
astonished the whale, and it dived at once, splashing the water all
around, and staving in the side of the boat with one of its flukes. The
water was shallow, though, and the fish soon came up again to spout, and
then started to run up the coast at the rate of sixty miles an hour.
This was about ten o'clock in the morning. They had also thrown another
harpoon into the fish, and the boat was being towed almost alongside,
near the tail. After towing them some fifty miles, the whale began to
grow tired, and then they stabbed it several times with the lance. It
soon died."</p>

<p>"Bravo, Bennie! Now how did you remember all that?"</p>

<p>"Why, I was perfectly certain you and auntie would want to know all
about it, and I just listened with all my might, so as I could tell you.
I do wish, though, you could have seen it for yourself."</p>

<p>"Suppose now that I did. I have seen many whales, both living and dead,
but such things always interest me, and I went in yesterday also to look
at this one."</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Horace! What did you think of the monster? Did you ever see
any other fish so big as that?"</p>

<p>"I am glad you asked your question in that shape, Ben. We will have a
little talk about whales. People generally have such incorrect ideas
concerning them that I think it is really worth while to give you some
instruction, and at all events to start you right, for we shall have
time now to make a start, and no more. In the first place, Bennie,
always remember a whale is <i>not a fish</i>, and in no way allied to
fishes."</p>

<p>"Why, Uncle Horace! What do you mean? Not a fish? I am sure I have read
about whale-fishing, and I know they live in the water like fish."</p>

<p>"There is where you are wrong, Ben. They live in the water, but not like
fish. Fish breathe under water, and die if taken out of it; whales can
not breathe under water any better than you could, and if kept there
would be drowned without fail. Whales have warm blood like ours; the
blood of fishes is cold."</p>

<p>"But how do whales breathe, then, Uncle Horace?"</p>

<p>"You have read of whales <i>spouting</i>, I am sure, Bennie. Their spouting
is their breathing. They go under water for their food, etc., holding
their breath while they are below. A sperm-whale can hold his breath an
hour at a time; a right-whale only about fifteen to twenty minutes. When
he comes to the surface he blows out his breath through his
'blow-holes,' which in the right-whale are on the top of the head. This
blowing is of course done with great force, and makes a sound which can
be heard at quite a long distance, and the water and mucus which the
blow-holes contained are driven out in a cloud of spray many feet in
height. That is the <i>spout</i> of a whale. You see always in pictures a
column of water represented; that is all foolishness. There is no such
thing; there is a puff of spray, and nothing more."</p>

<p>"I should think it was a hard way to live, Uncle Horace, to have to come
up to the surface every time I wanted to breathe."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the whale does not think so, Bennie. He comes to the surface as
naturally as you open your mouth. All his motion is made by the strokes
of his tail, which the whalemen call his 'flukes.' Now look at this
drawing of his flukes. It is shaped, you see, somewhat like a fish's
tail, but then it is not placed like one. The tail of a fish always has
its flat sides 'up and down,' so that when he strikes with it he swims
ahead or to either side as he chooses, and if he wishes to come to the
surface, he has to turn his tail in order to do it. The flukes of a
whale lie 'flat,' and every blow drives him ahead, or upward or
downward. A blow upward sends him flying toward the surface like a shot,
and he doubtless has no more idea of hardship in breathing than you
have."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see any other whale as large as this one, Uncle Horace?"</p>

<p>"This is one of very good size for its kind, but compared with many that
I have seen, it is small. And I am glad to correct for you, Bennie, the
statements which have been made about the size of this whale. It was
said to be sixty-nine feet long, and forty-five feet in circumference. I
measured it. Its length is not quite forty-nine feet, and its
circumference a little less than twenty-five. It was also said that
there were three kinds of whales, sperm-whales, fin-backs, and
right-whales; this one was called a right-whale. Now, Bennie, I can
count up over thirty species of whales at this moment, and there are
probably several others. There are two groups of them, bone-whales and
toothed whales, the first having whalebone, and the second, teeth
instead."</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Horace, have not all whales bones?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but that may not mean whalebone."</p>

<p>"That is queer. What other kind of bones can a whale have, I should like
to know? I should think they would be whalebone any way."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill_007.jpg" width="500" height="292" alt="" />
<span class="caption">SIDE VIEW OF THE MOUTH.</span>
</div>

<p>"I put it in that way, Ben, so as to draw your attention sharply to it.
<i>Whalebone</i> is not bone at all; it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span> totally different substance.
Look at these two drawings of the mouth of the whale you have just seen.
The first is made from the front, looking into the great opening, and
the figure of a child is placed there. This has been done to show you
how large it really is. And by-the-way, Bennie, in the mouth of a whale
of the largest size a grown man would appear no larger in proportion
than this child does now. The other is a side view of the mouth, lips,
etc.; inside the lips you can see the whalebone. This consists of a
series of flat plates, attached to the skull in the roof of the mouth,
and hanging down in a long row on each side between the great fat tongue
and the lip. They are longest in the middle of the length of the mouth,
and grow shorter toward the front and toward the rear. In the one here
represented I thought the longest plates would measure between five and
six feet, but I have seen many of them, taken from the whales of the
Northwest coast, which were fourteen to fifteen feet long. Each 'slab'
of bone is broadest at the top, and tapers downward, and its edge is
split into a sort of fringe, and it is by means of that that the
bonewhales secure their food. Look at those enormous lips standing up.
The whale drops his lips until they lie flat, and then, swimming slowly
along, the small molluscous animals on which he lives drift into his
mouth. When he thinks he has enough for a mouthful, he raises his lips,
and with his great tongue forces out the water between the plates of
bone, through the mat of fibres. The mollusca are caught on the fringe,
licked off, and swallowed. Seems like small food for such great animals,
perhaps, but this is their mode of living."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill_008.jpg" width="500" height="394" alt="" />
<span class="caption">FRONT VIEW OF THE MOUTH.</span>
</div>

<p>"Is this one a right-whale, Uncle Horace?"</p>

<p>"No, it is not. They call it so, and they probably are honest in their
statement, for the two species are very much alike. But the right-whale
is an arctic species, and is larger, being sometimes sixty-five feet
long; this species is, I think, never over fifty, and lives in the
Atlantic Ocean, not the arctic."</p>

<p>"Is sixty-five feet as long as any whales grow?"</p>

<p>"Oh no. Some of the fin-backs have been measured which were one hundred
and ten feet long, and I am sure I have seen them as long as that.
Whalemen, however, seldom kill them, for they make but little oil, and
they fight sometimes very fiercely when they are attacked."</p>

<p>"But isn't it strange, Uncle Horace, that such monstrous animals can be
killed. I should think they would kill the men who tried to fight them."</p>

<p>"So they do sometimes, but not very often. You have learned from Captain
Edwards of the instruments that are used to kill them&mdash;a harpoon and a
lance. When the whale-boat comes near enough to the whale, the harpoon,
to which a long rope is fastened, is thrown into him. The barb on the
harpoon prevents its being pulled out, and the poor whale swims off,
dragging the boat by the rope. When he becomes tired, the boat is drawn
up, and he is killed with a thrust of the lance. Sometimes the blow of
the harpoon kills him, but not often. Bomb-lances are now often used;
they are fired from a heavy gun, and explode after entering the body of
the whale, and of course kill him."</p>

<h2><a name="HOW_THE_SWALLOWS_STOPPED_THE_CLOCK" id="HOW_THE_SWALLOWS_STOPPED_THE_CLOCK">HOW THE SWALLOWS STOPPED THE CLOCK.</a></h2>

<p>Two newly married swallows, with the important business of building a
nest, on their minds, stopped to rest one morning on the hands of a
great church clock in the town of Newark, New Jersey. Presently they
noticed a little hole on its face just large enough for a swallow to
enter. They looked in, and saw a lovely place for a nest among a
collection of wheels that seemed perfectly quiet.</p>

<p>There is a great difference, you must know, in the movement of the
wheels of the great clocks. Some turn swiftly, while the larger ones
move so slowly that, unless they are watched for a long time, they seem
to be standing still.</p>

<p>The swallows thought it would be delicious to live in the clock. No boys
could disturb them, and unless some one should invent a new kind of
flying cat, they would never have any unwelcome and dangerous visitors.</p>

<p>So they began to build. They carried hay and grass and cotton into the
clock, and by night their nest was half finished. They slept in a
neighboring tree, and in the morning flew back with fresh building
materials.</p>

<p>Something very strange had happened. The nest that they had partly built
had nearly disappeared. They had to begin again. All that day they
worked hard. The next morning they found that the same cruel trick had
been played on them.</p>

<p>They now became very indignant, and that night they perched on the hands
of the clock, so as to be near in case any one should try to destroy
their nest. In the course of the night the hands of the clock turned
around and tumbled them off, but in the morning they saw that their nest
had only been slightly disturbed. They repaired the damage, finished
their work, and moved in that night.</p>

<p>For two days they were very happy, but on the third day a man climbed
into the tower to see why the clock had stopped. He found nearly a peck
of straw and grass and cotton that had been drawn by the wheels into the
inmost recesses of the clock, and had finally so clogged the wheels that
they could move no more. Then he found the nest that the swallows had
made, and threw it away, and stopped up the hole in the clock face.</p>

<p>And so it happened that the swallows had to go and build a nest under
the eaves after all.</p>

<h4>An Indian Story.</h4>

<p>olores's suggestion that he should purchase Rita from the Indian chief
had made a great impression upon Murray's mind. Steve's advice also
helped him to the conclusion that the plan was the best that could be
devised.</p>

<p>Many Bears had taken a great fancy both to Send Warning and to Knotted
Cord. The chief had indeed proposed more than once that his pale-face
friends should remain among the Apache band, and cast in their lots with
them. Meanwhile Murray held many an anxious consultation with Steve over
their plan.</p>

<p>"It's an idea, Steve; it's a good one," he said, finally, "and I'm going
to try and carry it out."</p>

<p>Still, it was a delicate piece of business, and Murray went at it very
carefully.</p>

<p>That afternoon, as they were riding along, Many Bears again remarked to
him that he would be better off among his Apache friends than anywhere
else. "Have lodge. Have squaw. Be chief a little. Be great brave."</p>

<p>"Got good lodge now."</p>

<p>"Yes, but lodge empty. Want squaw."</p>

<p>"Send Warning is old. No child. Rather have daughter. He has taken the
Knotted Cord for a son. All he needs now is a young squaw."</p>

<p>"Ugh! Good. All Apaches say Send Warning is wise. Know what he likes
best. Buy young squaw. Braves get killed in fight. Plenty young squaws
have no father. All glad to come into good lodge. Have plenty meat.
Plenty nice blanket. Good for squaw."</p>

<p>The notion of Many Bears was one that fitted him very well, for, as
chief of the band, it was his duty to keep an eye upon the fortunes of
its "orphans." There could be no better "asylum" for one of them than
the lodge of a wise old brave like Send Warning.</p>

<p>"No," said Murray, after a moment of silence. "Only one young squaw in
camp for me. The great chief must let me have Rita."</p>

<p>Many Bears was as nearly startled as an Indian chief could be by this
sudden and daring proposal. He shook his head. Only a chief who could
bring rich presents could expect to buy the daughter of a great man like
Many Bears. Something far beyond the power of a seemingly poor warrior
like Send Warning.</p>

<p>"Good," said Murray, calmly. "Heap give. Suppose you say what you think.
How big heap?"</p>

<p>There was a grim smile on the face of Many Bears as he turned and looked
in the face of his friend.</p>

<p>"How much? Ugh. Suppose chief bring fifty ponies?"</p>

<p>"Good," said Murray. "Go on."</p>

<p>"Fifty new blanket?"</p>

<p>"Good. All right."</p>

<p>"Five new gun. Fifty knife. Much heap powder. Big roll cloth for squaws.
What say?"</p>

<p>"Good. All right."</p>

<p>"Much pistol too. Suppose chief think of something more?"</p>

<p>"All right. Send Warning give it all."</p>

<p>"Ugh! No got 'em. No find 'em. Send Warning laugh at chief. Bad."</p>

<p>There was an offended look in his eyes, but Murray laid his hand on his
arm, saying:</p>

<p>"Listen. Send Warning is white. He is a great man among his own people.
He can give heap to chief. Can't find all here. Go to fort. See
blue-coat chief. See traders. Get all he wants there."</p>

<p>"Ugh! Good. Make Talking Leaf. Send it to fort. Young brave carry it.
All things come back."</p>

<p>Many Bears had seen something like that, and had never ceased envying
the white man's power to obtain presents by means of a little piece of
paper. Murray replied:</p>

<p>"No. Send Warning in no hurry. Wait till we get to fort."</p>

<p>That would not be for many days, and the more Many Bears thought of all
the good things he had mentioned, the more anxious he became to see his
adopted daughter set up in a lodge of her own, or at least under the
care of a warrior who was willing to give such a "big heap" for the
privilege. He "thought of something more" almost every hour from that
time on, but his demands were mainly for items of moderate cost, and he
did not feel at liberty to mention any larger number of ponies or
blankets.</p>

<p>"We can buy the blankets easily enough," said Steve, when he was told
the terms of the bargain, "but what about the ponies?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cheaper than blankets, my boy. I've seen droves of them going for ten
dollars a head. We won't have to give more than twenty. As to the other
things, there are always traders around the posts."</p>

<p>They had already counted the contents of their little buckskin bags, and
Steve had been surprised to find how much money there was in little more
than twenty pounds of gold coin. He had found, indeed, a strange
pleasure in counting it over and over, while Murray told him of his
beautiful home away across the sea.</p>

<p>"You'll be a rich man there."</p>

<p>"Have three or four times as much as this every year. You must come and
visit with me, Steve. As soon as you've seen your own people."</p>

<p>"I dare not think much of them, Murray. I can't talk about them. It will
be time enough when I learn if any of them are yet alive."</p>

<p>"Your father and mother?"</p>

<p>"Don't, Murray. I'd rather talk about Rita and our plans here."</p>

<p>Ni-ha-be was indignant at the proposed change. Rita had never imagined
until that moment how much she was beloved by the earnest-hearted Apache
girl. Ni-ha-be's arms were twining around her neck, and she was weeping
fiercely as she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"He shall not take you away from me. You are not a pale-face any more.
You are Apache."</p>

<p>Rita could not help crying, and the two friends were glad to go into the
lodge, as they were told, and mingle their tears together.</p>

<p>The nearest United States post at which there were likely to be any
traders was still a "two days' journey" to the northward, but Many Bears
had actually now received a message from his tribe that there would be
"heap presents" for those who should come in time to get them, and he
was more than ever anxious to discover if Send Warning had been telling
him the truth. His first proposition had been, as before, that Murray
should send for what he wanted, and have it brought to the Apache camp,
but that had been declared out of the question.</p>

<p>"Ugh! Good. Then Send Warning go with chief. Buy pony. Buy heap other
things. Come back and take young squaw to lodge."</p>

<p>"No. The great chief can bring young squaw with him. Send Warning take
then what he pay for. Give pony, take young squaw."</p>

<p>After some little argument, this was agreed to, but there were almost as
serious objections made to Steve Harrison's joining the party who were
to visit the post.</p>

<p>"Tell them I'm going anyhow," said Steve to Red Wolf, "whether they like
it or not. You come too. I'll buy you a new rifle. Best there is at the
fort." That settled the matter.</p>

<p>Both Dolores and Ni-ha-be were to be of the party.</p>

<p>"Rita," said Murray, in a low voice, the morning they rode out of the
village camp, "take a good look back. That's the last you will ever see
of it."</p>

<p>Then for the first time it came into the mind of Rita that she loved not
only Ni-ha-be, but all those wild, dark, savage people among whom she
had been living ever since she was a little girl.</p>

<p>"Father, will I never see any of them again?"</p>

<p>"I think not, Rita."</p>

<p>"You will let me send them presents, will you not?"</p>

<p>"As many as you please, Rita."</p>

<p>"Then I will make the whole village happy some day."</p>

<p>On arriving at the fort they were fortunate in finding a trader who had
bought a great many more ponies than he knew what to do with. Fifty of
them were promptly secured and turned over to Many Bears.</p>

<p>Even while that was being cared for, Murray sought and obtained two or
three important interviews. One was with the United States army officer
in command of the post, to whom he told his story.</p>

<p>"It's a little the biggest romance I ever heard of," said the gallant
Major. "I'll tell you what&mdash;you'd better have the final transfer made in
my presence."</p>

<p>"Thank you heartily. That will be just the thing."</p>

<p>The Major told the story as a great secret to his wife, and she told it
to the other ladies at the fort, and they all went wild together over a
grand new wardrobe for Rita. Never had any daughter of the Apaches owned
a tenth of the varied material the enthusiastic ladies prepared in less
than twenty-four hours after their first glimpse of Rita.</p>

<p>"We must make quite an affair," said the Major to Murray, "of your
making the payment. Then they will not think of trying to back out."</p>

<p>"There would be danger to Rita, I fear, if I were to make the truth
known publicly too soon."</p>

<p>Major Norris was an experienced "Indian fighter," and just the man to be
in command of such a post, for the reason that he had learned how much
cheaper it was to have the red men as friends than as enemies. He sent
word at once to Many Bears and a number of other "great chiefs" that
Send Warning was also a "great chief," and that proper honor must be
shown him by his pale-face friends on so great an occasion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was quite a procession that marched out of the fort barracks with
Rita on the day appointed. The Apache warriors and squaws who were
looking on felt that a high compliment was paid to their nation. There
were the troops drawn up in splendid array, with flags and cannon and
music, and the "white chiefs" in their bright uniforms.</p>

<p>There were the great warriors of several bands of the Apaches in their
paint and feathers. There were the beautiful white squaws in their
strange dresses. Many Bears had been looking very intently at a
collection of things just in front of where Major Norris was standing
with Murray and Steve Harrison. Ponies, blankets, guns&mdash;all, and more
than all, that had been agreed upon. No chief who was looking on could
say he had ever received more than that for one of his daughters, and
the heart of Many Bears swelled proudly within him. There was a cloud
upon his haughty face, however, and another on that of Red Wolf, who was
standing at his side. The clouds did not go away when they searched the
approaching party of ladies with their eyes for Rita.</p>

<p>Rita? Could that be the adopted daughter of Many Bears walking there
behind Mrs. Norris and Mother Dolores&mdash;the beautiful young lady whose
face was so very pale, and who was dressed so splendidly? They had never
before seen her look anything like that.</p>

<p>The band played, the soldiers "presented arms," the officers touched
their hats, and Murray stepped forward and held out his right hand to
Many Bears, pointing with his left to the ponies and things.</p>

<p>"There they are. Send Warning has kept his word. Rita is mine."</p>

<p>"Ugh! Good. Presents all right. Young squaw is the daughter of Send
Warning."</p>

<p>He shook hands heartily as he said it; but Murray had something more on
his mind, and was only waiting for the music to stop.</p>

<p>"Listen," he said. "I tell you a big truth. Rita is my own daughter.
When you burn ranche in Mexico many summers ago, burn mine, take horses,
cattle, mules, take away little girl&mdash;all that was mine. Got little girl
back now. Apaches all good friends of mine."</p>

<p>"Send Warning not come back to lodge?"</p>

<p>"Not now. Go to my own people for a while. Show them my daughter. Say
found her again."</p>

<p>"Ugh! Send Warning is a wise man. Cunning chief. Throw dust in the eyes
of the Apaches."</p>

<p>It was plain that the chief was troubled in his mind;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span> he hardly knew
whether to be angry or not. But there was no reasonable objection to
Murray's doing as he pleased with his own daughter after she had cost
him so many ponies.</p>

<p>Murray spoke again. "Send Warning say what great chief do. Let Ni-ha-be
come with Rita to pale-face lodges. Stay awhile. Learn to hear Talking
Leaves. Then come back to her friends. What say?"</p>

<p>The chief pondered a moment, but Ni-ha-be had heard and understood, and
a scared look arose in her face.</p>

<p>"Rita! Rita! you are going away? you will not be an Apache girl any
more?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/ill_012.jpg" width="600" height="459" alt="" />
<span class="caption">"'OH, NI-HA-BE, COME WITH ME!'"</span>
</div>

<p>"Oh, Ni-ha-be, come with me!"</p>

<p>Their arms were around each other, and they were both weeping; but
Ni-ha-be's mind was made up instantly.</p>

<p>"No. You are born white. You will go with your father. I am an Apache,
and I will go with my father."</p>

<p>Many Bears was listening. "Send Warning hear what young squaw say? All
Apaches say, good. She will stay with her own people."</p>

<p>Murray and Steve were anxious to begin their return to civilization, but
it would be several days before a "train" would go with an escort, and
they did not care to run any further risks. So the "farewell" was spread
over sufficient time to make all sorts of explanations and promises, and
Rita's mind became so full of dreams of her new life that she could
easily give up the old one.</p>

<p>Ni-ha-be had never seen so much of the pale-faces before, and Rita tried
again and again to persuade her to change her mind, but on the very last
morning of all she resolutely responded: "No, Rita, you are all
pale-face. All over. Head and heart both belong with white friends. Feel
happy. Ni-ha-be only little Indian girl here. Out there on plains, among
mountains, Ni-ha-be is the daughter of a great chief. She is an Apache."</p>

<p>No doubt she was right, but she and Rita had a good long cry over it
then, and probably more than one afterward.</p>

<p>As for Dolores, she came to the fort to say good-by, but neither Many
Bears nor Red Wolf came with her.</p>

<p>"The heart of the great chief is sore," she said, "and he mourns for his
pale-face daughter. Not want to speak."</p>

<p>Out from the gates of the fort that morning wheeled the cavalry escort
of the waiting "train" of supply wagons and traders' "outfits," and
behind the cavalry rode a little group of three.</p>

<p>The ladies of the garrison, with the Major and the rest, had said their
last farewells at the gates, and the homeward journey had begun.</p>

<p>"Steve," said Murray, "are you a Lipan or an Apache to-day?"</p>

<p>"Seems to me that is all ever so long ago. I am white again."</p>

<p>"So am I. At one time I had little hope that I ever should be. I never
would if I had not found Rita. Oh, my daughter!"</p>

<p>"Father! Father, see&mdash;there she is! Oh, Ni-ha-be!"</p>

<p>A swift and beautiful mustang was bounding toward them across the plain
from a sort of cloud of wild-looking figures at a little distance, and
on its back was a form they all knew well.</p>

<p>Nearer it came, and nearer.</p>

<p>"She wants to say good-by again."</p>

<p>Nearer still, so near that they could almost look into her dark
streaming eyes, and Rita held out her arms beseechingly; but at that
moment the mustang was suddenly reined in and wheeled to the right
about, while Ni-ha-be clasped both hands upon her face.</p>

<p>"Ni-ha-be! Oh, Ni-ha-be!"</p>

<p>But she was gone like the wind, and she did not come again.</p>

<p>"There, Rita," said her father. "It is all for the best. All your Indian
life is gone, like mine and Steve's. We have something better before us
now."</p>

<h2><a name="MORE_ABOUT_KITES" id="MORE_ABOUT_KITES">MORE ABOUT KITES.</a></h2>

<div class="figright" style="width: 125px;">
<img src="images/ill_013.jpg" width="125" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Last week, boys, I told you how to make a very simple kite. Now for a
few variations from the usual commonplace plan. There are a number of
novel designs in the way of kites that it only requires a little
ingenuity to carry out.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 214px;">
<img src="images/ill_014.jpg" width="214" height="250" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Suppose that you want your kite for a travelling companion; It would be
a very awkward piece of baggage, would it not? Well, you can make a very
good kite of the shape shown in the illustration, covered with muslin,
and the frame made to work upon a pivot, so that it can be folded and
carried in a case. The muslin must be fastened permanently to one piece
of the frame only; it must be simply tied to the others with small
pieces of string. Thus, on being released, the laths may be worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
round on the pivot until they are in a straight line, and the muslin
wrapped round them. Sometimes they are made with only two pieces, an
upright and a cross-piece, but the principle is the same. If expense is
of no consideration, oiled silk is far better than muslin, since it is
so much lighter.</p>

<p>In China, the boys about the streets of Hong-Kong have a very amusing
and simply constructed kite, which can be made to perform the most
astonishing gyrations in the air. You might be inclined at first to
doubt if the thing could go up at all; but just give it a fair trial,
and see. You will be surprised at the ease with which it catches the air
and mounts upward.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/ill_015.jpg" width="300" height="287" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The kite is composed of two very thin slips of rattan, or bamboo,
properly smoothed, and a piece of colored tissue-paper cut in the form
shown in the above diagram. The middle stick is flat on one side, and
should be eighteen and a half inches long; the bow stick should be
twenty-five inches long, and nearly round. The paper should be cut to
measure fourteen inches on each side.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 127px;">
<img src="images/ill_016.jpg" width="127" height="250" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 173px;">
<img src="images/ill_017.jpg" width="173" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Lay the middle stick, well covered on the flat side with good stiff
flour paste, diagonally across the paper, fastening it at both ends with
bands across, and let it stand till dry; then fold down the upper
corners of the paper over the bow stick, pasting it down firmly. Add a
small fan-shaped piece of tissue-paper for the "bob-tail," and the kite
is ready. Fasten one end of the "belly-band" to the two sticks where
they cross, and the other end about the same distance from the tail of
the kite. Be careful about adjusting the balance when tying on the
string, as if that is not right the kite will not fly upward.</p>

<p>As to the decorations of his kite, each boy must follow his own fancy,
remembering that, since the effect is to be produced from a distance,
only the most glaring colors can be used, and that fine and finished
details will be of no use whatever. One of the prettiest kites now in
use is that which represents a hawk with outspread wings, and it can be
purchased at almost any toy store. But if any boy will be careful in his
work, he can easily make one. The frame must be made of cane or some
very light and flexible wood. When in the air it will sweep backward and
forward with movements exactly like those of a hawk when wheeling about
in search of prey.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">One summer's night when all was still,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">And motionless the wheel,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Some rats ran through the village mill,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">And stole a bag of meal.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And hurry-scurry, tooth and nail,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">They dragged it to the door,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And then upon their shoulders soon</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">Away the treasure bore.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">But as they hastened from the room,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">Along a narrow plank,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">The heavy load went in the flume,</span><br />

<blockquote>

<p>I am a boy eleven years old, and my home is in Indiana, a mile from
the State line of Ohio. My papa owns a farm here, and we are
farmers, so that I have plenty to do in the summer-time working in
the garden and around, and evenings and mornings I help to milk the
cows. In the winter I go to school. I like to go first rate,
especially when Miss Y. is our teacher. When we do not go to
school, my brother Elmar and I and some more boys and girls who
live near by go over to my grandpa's an evening or two in every
week, and grandma teaches us. I like to study geography especially.
My brother Elmar is older than I, and we take <span class="smcap">Harper's Young People</span>
together. When we meet at grandpa's, Elmar and I take our <span class="smcap">Young
People</span> along, so that the rest of the children who go can hear the
nice stories in it, and after lessons are recited, grandma reads to
us all. I liked "A Battle of Icebergs" in No. 124; we all did. And
I like the letters in Our Post-office Box, especially where they
write from Europe. I should like to sail on the large steamers to
Europe. I would want to visit Switzerland, where William Tell and
his brave little Albert lived. And I would like to see Lake Geneva,
and the tall white peaks of the Alps reflected in the clear water.
And I think it would be gay fun to go to Berne in their holidays,
and see the people marching around in the streets wrapped in
bear-skins, "playing" they are bears. But we have some good times
here. My grandma wrote a story, and read it to us last week after
lessons. The story was concerning a lady who made a party to please
a lot of young people. When the names were announced at the door,
they were all our own first names. The surnames were changed. I
will ask grandma for the story to send with this letter, and hope
the Postmistress will please print both. If they should be printed
week after next, I would read them for my piece at our exhibition.</p></blockquote>

</p>

<p>The Postmistress is sorry that she has not room for your grandmamma's
story in Our Post-office Box with your letter. She has put it safely
away in a drawer of her desk, and perhaps one of these days she will be
able to find a niche for it. You were very kind to copy it so plainly.
Although you have not visited Europe, your letter shows that you have
read and studied about its peoples and places, so if you ever do go
there, you will be prepared to enjoy the new scenes intelligently.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We are pleased to hear again from our correspondent Alberto, who has
written to us from several places which he has visited in Europe. We are
glad that his bright eyes see so well what the little ones at home will
find pleasure in reading about:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Perhaps some of the young people would like to hear about the
Carnival of Rome. Mamma hired a window in the Corso twice, and also
a carriage, so that when we got tired of our balcony we could see
all the fun and frolic of the crowd. From the balcony we could see
how gay the whole Corso looked, with flags and banners flying, and
bright-colored strips of cloth hanging out of all the windows, and
over the balconies, which were full of people. The street was
filled with carriages going up and down, and a merry crowd on foot
darted in and out among them, dressed up in comical costumes.</p>

<p>Then commenced the throwing of the <i>coriandoli</i>, which were little
lumps of clay covered with chalk. People seemed to take great
pleasure in throwing these at each other. This they followed by
showering every one with small bouquets of flowers. I think the
flowers were better than the <i>coriandoli</i>, as they did not hurt so
much.</p>

<p>The fun every day closed with a horse-race. The horses had no
riders, but attached to their flanks were leaden balls with sharp
points, which urged them on like spurs. When the signal was given
they dashed through the crowd, which just opened a moment to let
them pass, and tore along until they were stopped at the other end
of the Corso, where the judge sat to proclaim the winner. But the
last night was very gay, for then every one had little candles, and
the fun was to keep one's own light burning and blow out one's
neighbor's. Some held a taper in one hand, and a fan made of
feathers in the other for blowing out the candles. When the tapers
were blown out all would cry "Senza moccolo," which means without
light. The Carnival finished with a grand procession; maskers
carried colored lanterns, which represented fruit, flowers,
animals, moon, and stars; finally, a huge car came, in which was
the King of the Carnival in a dying state, and a crowd of people
behind weeping over him. It was a grand sight, and I wish that some
of the readers of <span class="smcap">Young People</span> could have seen it also.</p></blockquote>

<p>The little sentence which inspired this graceful poem was written by
Victor Hugo, the venerable poet of France, in the album of a young girl
who had begged for his autograph. Victor Hugo is a lover of children, as
our own Longfellow was. Shall we translate the French for those who do
not read that beautiful language? It means "like glass to quiver," or
answer back to the touch; "like brass to resist." The poem will help you
to understand the meaning of this sentiment. " vos pieds,
mademoiselle," means "At your feet," or, as we would say, "Your most
obedient, miss."</p>

<p>My papa gave me <span class="smcap">Harper's Young People</span> for a birthday present. I
like it very much indeed. L. Pearlie S. said she had a hen that
killed all but the black ones in her brood. Mamma says she once had
a hen that did not like black chickens, so she tried to kill all
she saw in her brood, and others too. I like chickens very much. I
have twenty-one chickens&mdash;nine hens, one rooster, and eleven little
chicks. One year I had thirty-eight chickens, two turkeys, and four
Pintados.</p>

<p>I don't see how any one can help liking sweet, gentle, loving cats.
I have a cat nearly four years old. She can't do any tricks; she
only curls up under the stove when she can't get into my lap. But I
like her very much; she is the only pet I have. I have no brother
nor sister, except a grown sister who is married.</p>

<p>I have a flower and a vegetable garden. I like to go to school very
much, but I do not go now, as I was sick and had to stop. I think
Jimmy Brown's adventures are so very funny! I make a good many
Wiggles, but I have never sent any. I often see some just like
mine, though.</p>

<p>I am making two quilts. One is made out of the pieces that are too
little for the other, and the other is a "memory quilt." Maybe some
of the little readers would like to know what a memory quilt is. It
can be of any pattern, provided it has a light-colored piece in the
middle. The little girl who has it makes a square, and gives it to
one of her friends, who makes another like it for her. The name can
be worked or printed in the middle. When all her friends have made
one, she puts them together, and has a quilt.</p>

<p>I would be very glad to see this in print, as no one knows I am
writing it except mamma. Good-by.</p></blockquote>

I like her ever so much. I have ten dolls, and mamma says some of
them are dilapidated. My oldest doll is a rag doll, which my aunt
gave me when I was six months old. We live in Sioux River Valley,
and the river is full of trout. I caught one in a little brook that
runs past the door. A great many people come here in the summer to
fish. There are some very large hills, all around us, covered with
pine-trees, and pretty both in summer and winter. I never saw any
hills, pine-trees, or rocks until we came here two years ago. About
a mile from here is what we call the rapids. It is just beautiful!
Such large rocks, covered with such pretty green mosses! I wish you

<p>Mamma says I may tell you two funny stories, because they are true:</p>

<p>There are two old colored people living at Fort L., near the
school-house. Their names are Toby and Isabel. Toby keeps the
school-house clean, but Isabel is so old and fat that she can not
work much. One day my aunt met her on the road, and asked her where
she had been. She said, "Oh, I've been helpin' Tobe in de school."
"Why, you can't help him sweep, can you?" said auntie. "No; but
Tobe he make so much dust when he sweep, an' it make him cough so,
I t'ought I would go an' stand by him, so some of de dust would go
down my froat, an' den Tobe wouldn't get so much on his lungs to
make him cough so."</p>

<p>My sister teaches a school in the country, and one of her pupils is
a little colored boy by the name of Nick. The other day he came
into the room, crying bitterly, and said, "Teacher, the boys are
all the time calling me names." She said, "What do they call you?"
"They call me Nicholas, and that isn't my name; it's Nicky."</p></blockquote>

<p>My uncle, who lives in New York, sends us <span class="smcap">Harper's Young People</span> and
<span class="smcap">Harper's Weekly</span>, both of which we like very much. I must tell you
about my pets. I have a black-and-tan terrier named Tiny, and a
jackdaw which talks quite plainly. My sister has a tabby cat and a
canary-bird. We have not had any snow this winter. We have had
primroses and daisies in bloom all the time.</p>

<p>I went over the Canterbury Cathedral, and saw the tomb of Edward
the Black Prince, and the shrine of Thomas  Becket, the murdered
Archbishop of Canterbury. The stone in front of the altar is worn
into hollows where the pilgrims used to kneel. Last Saturday
Colonel Brine and Mr. Simmons went up in a large balloon from
Canterbury, to cross the Channel from Dover to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span> Calais. The wind
changed, and they came down in the middle of the Channel, and were
picked up by the mail-packet, and brought back to Dover. We are
very sorry Barnum has bought our elephant Jumbo. I hope he will be
stubborn, and won't go, for I'm sure we want him more than the
little American boys and girls do. I hope I have not made my letter
too long to go in your Post-office Box.</p></blockquote>

<p>Going up in a balloon would be much better fun if people could only be
sure that they would not come plunging down on the top of a high
mountain, into the depths of a wood, or, like those unfortunate
gentlemen, plump into the middle of a body of water. Why did you feel so
badly about letting your little American friends see Jumbo? By the time
you read this perhaps we will understand how it was that the English
children were so fond of this big elephant that they grieved over
sparing him to us. We wish we had some huge American pet to send over
the Atlantic to take his place in your affections.</p>

<p>I am fourteen, and a fond reader of <span class="smcap">Harper's Young People</span>. I have

mamma is often not able to leave her bed.</p>

<p>I never went from home to school in my life. Mamma has always

French, Latin, and music, with an abundance of excellent reading,
so I'm very busy.</p>

<p>Do you like to darn stockings, Postmistress? I don't enjoy it,
though I have done it for four years, and mamma says I do it
beautifully.</p>

<p>I have just read Ellen McC.'s letter, of Palmyra, Missouri, and am
so sorry for her. I "always sew the paper." I hope she will be able
to get out in the open air when the "leaves and flowers come." I
should like to take her with me in some of my nice long walks to
the tops of these high hills; to one especially, from which we can
see a great deal of the country, and the mountains in the distance
which bound the Shenandoah Valley&mdash;the beautiful Blue Ridge east,
and the Alleghany Mountains west. Our farm is in a pretty miniature
valley, with woods in front and in the rear, great oak-trees that
wave and toss their huge arms in this raging March wind.
Massannuten Mountain bounds our view on the north, and South
Mountain on the south. About ten miles distant is the "Old Stone
Church," the first Presbyterian church in the Valley of Virginia,
built in colonial times, and used as a fort of defense against the
Indians, and also as a "meeting-house." It is known now as Augusta
Church, and is situated in a beautiful oak grove. In the suburbs of
Staunton there is a large old-fashioned house that was occupied for
a while by the Hessians during the Revolution. We live about three

<blockquote>

<p>I think "The Talking Leaves" has been so nice. So many write about
pets, but the only pet I have is my baby sister Maggie. I read
about the violets that the little boy in Texas sent you. Last
winter I went into my grandma's garden when the snow was about a
foot deep, and pushing it away, found pansies as bright as in the
summer. Papa, mamma, and I got that Monogram Puzzle right. I know
three real nice games for playing in the house. One is "Forty
Questions and Three Guesses." One player thinks of something; for
example, the player chooses the word "Steel," but does not name it
aloud; then the others ask questions about it&mdash;what it looks like,
what its use is, and everything they can think of. By-and-by they
find that it is a mineral, and they may guess three times as to
what mineral it is. Another nice game is "Geographical Spelling."
The first player spells the name of a city, river, lake, or
whatever the players decide on. The next one spells the name of a
lake (if it has been decided to have all lakes) the first letter of
which is the last letter of the name that the first player spelled,
and so they go around until the lakes are exhausted, after which
you can take something else. The other game is called "Stillwater."
One person is blindfolded, and stands and counts twenty. By that
time the rest must have taken places, and must keep perfectly still
until some one is found. The one who is first found takes the place
of the one who was blindfolded. Good-by.</p></blockquote>

We call him Peter the Great; and indeed he makes a great noise

brother Charlie Ross, who is now at school in Rhode Island, named
him Ivan the Terrible. He can shut the door, walk on his hind-legs,
sit up and beg, and can jump a stick ever so high, and only has to
be told a few times.</p>

letter (for he was too ill to write), with his autograph and the
date in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">How Girls may Entertain each Other</span>.&mdash;The idea that in order to entertain
company it is necessary to go to a great deal of trouble and expense
prevents many young people from really enjoying themselves together. The
other day I was present when Florilla asked her mother for permission to
invite a number of her girl friends to a birthday party.</p>

<p>"I am quite willing, dear, to let you invite your favorite school-mates
to luncheon or to tea, and I will provide a simple entertainment for
them," said the mother, pleasantly, "but I can not consent to your
having a regular evening company."</p>

<p>Florilla thought she could not be contented with a daytime party of any
kind, so her birthday is to pass unmarked, and a dozen girls, who might
have had some charming hours with each other, will all stay at home just
as usual.</p>

<p>When you think of it, dears, it is not upon dainty eatables nor pretty
dresses that you depend for enjoyment, but on the spirit which prevails,
on bright talk, music, games, fun, and gay good-humor, all of which are
within reach of everybody.</p>

<p>I have a friend who lives in a quiet little place near a beautiful
sheltered bay. Her brother owns a boat. Sometimes, on a summer day, at
the noonday meal, it will occur to one of the family that it would be
pleasant to have a picnic in the afternoon. One child is sent off to
notify the cousins up the street, and another messenger goes for Emily,
or John, or Lucy, who is a favorite on such occasions. A basket of
sandwiches and gingerbread is provided, and at three or four o'clock the
large boat is filled, the white sail is spread, and away goes a merry
party to enjoy the shining water, the salt air, and the hard, smooth
beach.</p>

<p>A little mountain party might be arranged by girls who live among the
hills, in just such an easy fashion as this.</p>

<p>In the city, most girls would find, now that fine weather is here, great
pleasure in a morning spent in the parks, or the rural suburbs which are
within a short distance of most towns. It would always be well on such
occasions to ask mamma or some grown-up friend to accompany the party.</p>

<p>A hostess must never forget that it is her duty to see that her guests
enjoy themselves. For instance, one girl may have travelled. Let her
have an opportunity of telling about the lovely places she has visited.
A good hostess would ask her beforehand to bring views and photographs
with her. Another, who plays well, might be asked for music; but as
everybody is not alike fond of even this accomplishment, the whole time
should not be taken up with songs and pieces. Neglect nobody, if you
wish your company to be a pleasant one, and if strangers are present,
introduce them to those they are likely to find most agreeable.</p>
